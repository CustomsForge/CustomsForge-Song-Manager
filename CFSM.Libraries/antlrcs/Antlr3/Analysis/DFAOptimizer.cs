    /** A module to perform optimizations on DFAs.
     *
     *  I could more easily (and more quickly) do some optimizations (such as
     *  PRUNE_EBNF_EXIT_BRANCHES) during DFA construction, but then it
     *  messes up the determinism checking.  For example, it looks like
     *  loop exit branches are unreachable if you prune exit branches
     *  during DFA construction and before determinism checks.
     *
     *  In general, ANTLR's NFA->DFA->codegen pipeline seems very robust
     *  to me which I attribute to a uniform and consistent set of data
     *  structures.  Regardless of what I want to "say"/implement, I do so
     *  within the confines of, for example, a DFA.  The code generator
     *  can then just generate code--it doesn't have to do much thinking.
     *  Putting optimizations in the code gen code really starts to make
     *  it a spagetti factory (uh oh, now I'm hungry!).  The pipeline is
     *  very testable; each stage has well defined input/output pairs.
     *
     *  ### Optimization: PRUNE_EBNF_EXIT_BRANCHES
     *
     *  There is no need to test EBNF block exit branches.  Not only is it
     *  an unneeded computation, but counter-intuitively, you actually get
     *  better errors. You can report an error at the missing or extra
     *  token rather than as soon as you've figured out you will fail.
     *
     *  Imagine optional block "( DOT CLASS )? SEMI".  ANTLR generates:
     *
     *  int alt=0;
     *  if ( input.LA(1)==DOT ) {
     *      alt=1;
     *  }
     *  else if ( input.LA(1)==SEMI ) {
     *      alt=2;
     *  }
     *
     *  Clearly, since Parser.match() will ultimately find the error, we
     *  do not want to report an error nor do we want to bother testing
     *  lookahead against what follows the (...)?  We want to generate
     *  simply "should I enter the subrule?":
     *
     *  int alt=2;
     *  if ( input.LA(1)==DOT ) {
     *      alt=1;
     *  }
     *
     *  NOTE 1. Greedy loops cannot be optimized in this way.  For example,
     *  "(greedy=false:'x'|.)* '\n'".  You specifically need the exit branch
     *  to tell you when to terminate the loop as the same input actually
     *  predicts one of the alts (i.e., staying in the loop).
     *
     *  NOTE 2.  I do not optimize cyclic DFAs at the moment as it doesn't
     *  seem to work. ;)  I'll have to investigate later to see what work I
     *  can do on cyclic DFAs to make them have fewer edges.  Might have
     *  something to do with the EOT token.
     *
     *  ### PRUNE_SUPERFLUOUS_EOT_EDGES
     *
     *  When a token is a subset of another such as the following rules, ANTLR
     *  quietly assumes the first token to resolve the ambiguity.
     *
     *  EQ			: '=' ;
     *  ASSIGNOP	: '=' | '+=' ;
     *
     *  It can yield states that have only a single edge on EOT to an accept
     *  state.  This is a waste and messes up my code generation. ;)  If
     *  Tokens rule DFA goes
     *
     * 		s0 -'='-> s3 -EOT-> s5 (accept)
     *
     *  then s5 should be pruned and s3 should be made an accept.  Do NOT do this
     *  for keyword versus ID as the state with EOT edge emanating from it will
     *  also have another edge.
     *
     *  ### Optimization: COLLAPSE_ALL_INCIDENT_EDGES
     *
     *  Done during DFA construction.  See method addTransition() in
     *  NFAToDFAConverter.
     *
     *  ### Optimization: MERGE_STOP_STATES
     *
     *  Done during DFA construction.  See addDFAState() in NFAToDFAConverter.

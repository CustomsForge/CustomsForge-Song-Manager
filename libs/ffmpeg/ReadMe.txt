Did not find the required 'ffmpeg.exe' file ...

To use the CFSM Auto Adjust CDLC Volume feature, please download FFmpegSetup.rar
from the Audiosmith for Rocksmith 2014 download page at: http://goo.gl/i9jXEZ

Run FFmpegSetup.exe as admin.  When you are asked to 'Select Destination Location' 
type the following path: C:\Program Files (x86)\CustomsForgeSongManager\ 
or enter the custom path of where you installed CustomsForgeSongManager.exe.

Note: If you used 'Browse...' to Select Destination Location then make sure
you remove (back space over) the auto added '\Audiosmith' subfolder from
the path before continuing the installation process.

To confirm that FFmpeg is properly installed check that the ffmpeg.exe file
exists at: C:\Program Files (x86)\CustomsForgeSongManager\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe

Operational Footnotes:
======================

CFSM Auto Adjust CDLC Volume feature measures the CDLC audio LUFS and
then attempts to adjust the toolkit CDLC Audio Loudness Factor (LF) so that the
audio volume of the CDLC is more representative of a commonly desired audio 
volume.  CFSM does NOT normalize the CDLC audio, it merely adjusts the
volume setting.  CFSM does not alter the original audio file in any way.   

If you want to apply true EBU R128 Standard audio normalization to your CDLC
collection then give the Audiosmith for Rocksmith 2014 application a try.  
Normalization modifies the bit structure of the original audio file.  You can
download the full version of Audiosmith at: http://goo.gl/i9jXEZ 

You may want to give both methods a try, to see which works best on your CDLC.

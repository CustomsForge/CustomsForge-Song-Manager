         * nor will "/ud800".  To keep things as compact as possible we use the following encoding
         * if the int is below 255, we encode as hex literal
         * If the int is between 255 and 0x7fff we use a single unicode literal with the value
         * If the int is above 0x7fff, we use a unicode literal of 0x80hh, where hh is the high-order
         * bits followed by \xll where ll is the lower order bits of a 16-bit number.
         *
         * Ideally this should be improved at a future date.  The most optimal way to encode this
         * may be a compressed AMF encoding that is embedded using an Embed tag in ActionScript.

    /** A DFA state represents a set of possible NFA configurations.
     *  As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
     *  to keep track of all possible states the NFA can be in after
     *  reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
     *  input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
     *  subset T of the states of the NFA that are reachable from the
     *  NFA's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
     *  In conventional NFA->DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
     *  would be a bitset representing the set of states the
     *  NFA could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
     *  state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
     *  a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
     *  jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
     *  Recall that NFAs do not normally have a stack like a pushdown-machine
     *  so I have to add one to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
     *  the underlying LL grammar from which the NFA was derived.
     *
     *  I use a list of NFAConfiguration objects.  An NFAConfiguration
     *  is both a state (ala normal conversion) and an NFAContext describing
     *  the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.  There
     *  is also the semantic context, which is the "set" of predicates found
     *  on the path to this configuration.
     *
     *  A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
     *  but with different NFAContexts (with same or different alts)
     *  meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.

         *  (if s[i]-t is nil, don't add).  The remainder is t-s[i], which is
         *  what you want to add to the set minus what was already there.  The
         *  remainder must then be compared against the i+1..n elements in s
         *  looking for another collision.  Each collision results in a smaller
         *  and smaller remainder.  Stop when you run out of s elements or
         *  remainder goes to nil.  If remainder is non nil when you run out of
         *  s elements, then add remainder to the end.

         *  Single element labels are treated as sets to make the code uniform.

         *  For syntactic predicates, we only want to generate predicate
         *  evaluations as it transitions to an accept state; waste to
         *  do it earlier.  So, only add gated preds derived from manually-
         *  specified syntactic predicates if this is an accept state.
         *
         *  Also, since configurations w/o gated predicates are like true
         *  gated predicates, finding a configuration whose alt has no gated
         *  predicate implies we should evaluate the predicate to true. This
         *  means the whole edge has to be ungated. Consider:
         *
         *	 X : ('a' | {p}?=> 'a')
         *	   | 'a' 'b'
         *	   ;

         *  Here, you 'a' gets you from s0 to s1 but you can't test p because
         *  plain 'a' is ok.  It's also ok for starting alt 2.  Hence, you can't
         *  test p.  Even on the edge going to accept state for alt 1 of X, you
         *  can't test p.  You can get to the same place with and w/o the context.
         *  Therefore, it is never ok to test p in this situation. 
         *

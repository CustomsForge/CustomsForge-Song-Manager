         *  }
         *  else error
         *
         *  Clearly, alt 3 is predicted with extra work since it tests 0..7
         *  and [lL] before finally realizing that any character is actually
         *  ok at k=2.
         *
         *  A better decision is as follows:
         *
         *  if ( (input.LA(1)>='1' && input.LA(1)&lt;='9') ) {
         *      alt7=1;
         *  }
         *  else if ( input.LA(1)=='0' ) {
         *      if ( input.LA(2)=='X'||input.LA(2)=='x' ) {
         *          alt7=2;
         *      }
         *      else {
         *          alt7=3;
         *      }
         *  }
         *
         *  The DFA originally has 3 edges going to the state the predicts alt 3,
         *  but upon seeing the EOT edge (the "else"-clause), this method
         *  replaces the old merged label (which would have (0..7|l|L)) with EOT.
         *  The code generator then leaves alt 3 predicted with a simple else-
         *  clause. :)
         *
         *  The only time the EOT optimization makes no sense is in the Tokens
         *  rule.  We want EOT to truly mean you have matched an entire token
         *  so don't bother actually rewinding to execute that rule unless there
         *  are actions in that rule.  For now, since I am not preventing
         *  backtracking from Tokens rule, I will simply allow the optimization.

         *  collect predicates at hoisting depth 0, meaning before any token/char
         *  have been recognized.  This corresponds, during analysis, to the
         *  initial DFA start state construction closure() invocation.
         *
         *  There are four cases of interest (the last being the usual transition):
         *
         *   1. Traverse an edge that takes us to the start state of another
         *      rule, r.  We must push this state so that if the DFA
         *      conversion hits the end of rule r, then it knows to continue
         *      the conversion at state following state that "invoked" r. By
         *      construction, there is a single transition emanating from a rule
         *      ref node.
         *
         *   2. Reach an NFA state associated with the end of a rule, r, in the
         *      grammar from which it was built.  We must add an implicit (i.e.,
         *      don't actually add an epsilon transition) epsilon transition
         *      from r's end state to the NFA state following the NFA state
         *      that transitioned to rule r's start state.  Because there are
         *      many states that could reach r, the context for a rule invocation
         *      is part of a call tree not a simple stack.  When we fall off end
         *      of rule, "pop" a state off the call tree and add that state's
         *      "following" node to d's NFA configuration list.  The context
         *      for this new addition will be the new "stack top" in the call tree.
         *
         *   3. Like case 2, we reach an NFA state associated with the end of a
         *      rule, r, in the grammar from which NFA was built.  In this case,
         *      however, we realize that during this NFA->DFA conversion, no state
         *      invoked the current rule's NFA.  There is no choice but to add
         *      all NFA states that follow references to r's start state.  This is
         *      analogous to computing the FOLLOW(r) in the LL(k) world.  By
         *      construction, even rule stop state has a chain of nodes emanating
         *      from it that points to every possible following node.  This case
         *      is conveniently handled then by the 4th case.
         *
         *   4. Normal case.  If p can reach another NFA state q, then add
         *      q to d's configuration list, copying p's context for q's context.
         *      If there is a semantic predicate on the transition, then AND it
         *      with any existing semantic context.
         *
         *   Current state p is always added to d's configuration list as it's part
         *   of the closure as well.
         *
         *  When is a closure operation in a cycle condition?  While it is
         *  very possible to have the same NFA state mentioned twice
         *  within the same DFA state, there are two situations that
         *  would lead to nontermination of closure operation:
         *
         *  o   Whenever closure reaches a configuration where the same state
         *      with same or a suffix context already exists.  This catches
         *      the IF-THEN-ELSE tail recursion cycle and things like
         *
         *      a : A a | B ;
         *
         *      the context will be $ (empty stack).
         *
         *      We have to check
         *      larger context stacks because of (...)+ loops.  For
         *      example, the context of a (...)+ can be nonempty if the
         *      surrounding rule is invoked by another rule:
         *
         *      a : b A | X ;
         *      b : (B|)+ ;  // nondeterministic by the way
         *
         *      The context of the (B|)+ loop is "invoked from item
         *      a : . b A ;" and then the empty alt of the loop can reach back
         *      to itself.  The context stack will have one "return
         *      address" element and so we must check for same state, same
         *      context for arbitrary context stacks.
         *
         *      Idea: If we've seen this configuration before during closure, stop.
         *      We also need to avoid reaching same state with conflicting context.
         *      Ultimately analysis would stop and we'd find the conflict, but we
         *      should stop the computation.  Previously I only checked for
         *      exact config.  Need to check for same state, suffix context
         * 		not just exact context.
         *
         *  o   Whenever closure reaches a configuration where state p
         *      is present in its own context stack.  This means that
         *      p is a rule invocation state and the target rule has
         *      been called before.  NFAContext.MAX_RECURSIVE_INVOCATIONS
         *      (See the comment there also) determines how many times
         *      it's possible to recurse; clearly we cannot recurse forever.
         *      Some grammars such as the following actually require at
         *      least one recursive call to correctly compute the lookahead:
         *
         *      a : L ID R
         *        | b
         *        ;
         *      b : ID
         *        | L a R
         *        ;
         *
         *      Input L ID R is ambiguous but to figure this out, ANTLR
         *      needs to go a->b->a->b to find the L ID sequence.
         *
         *      Do not allow closure to add a configuration that would
         *      allow too much recursion.
         *
         *      This case also catches infinite left recursion.

         *  The NFA decision is therefore syntactically indistinguishable
         *  from the left edge upon at least one input sequence.  We may
         *  terminate the NFA to DFA conversion for these paths since no

         *  these conjoined twins once interwined to make things
         *  deterministic (unless there are semantic predicates; see below).
         *
         *  Upon a nondeterministic set of NFA configurations, we should
         *  report a problem to the grammar designer and resolve the issue
         *  by aribitrarily picking the first alternative (this usually

         *  associated with the other alts. Rather than remove conflicting
         *  NFA configurations, I set the "resolved" bit so that future
         *  computations will ignore them.  In this way, we maintain the
         *  complete DFA state with all its configurations, but prevent
         *  future DFA conversion operations from pursuing undesirable
         *  paths.  Remember that we want to terminate DFA conversion as
         *  soon as we know the decision is deterministic *or*
         *  nondeterministic.
         *
         *  [BTW, I have convinced myself that there can be at most one
         *  set of nondeterministic configurations in a DFA state.  Only NFA
         *  configurations arising from the same input sequence can appear
         *  in a DFA state.  There is no way to have another complete set
         *  of nondeterministic NFA configurations without another input
         *  sequence, which would reach a different DFA state.  Therefore,
         *  the two nondeterministic NFA configuration sets cannot collide
         *  in the same DFA state.]
         *
         *  Consider DFA state {(s|1),(s|2),(s|3),(t|3),(v|4)} where (s|a)
         *  is state 's' and alternative 'a'.  Here, configuration set
         *  {(s|1),(s|2),(s|3)} predicts 3 different alts.  Configurations
         *  (s|2) and (s|3) are "resolved", leaving {(s|1),(t|3),(v|4)} as
         *  items that must still be considered by the DFA conversion
         *  algorithm in DFA.findNewDFAStatesAndAddDFATransitions().
         *
         *  Consider the following grammar where alts 1 and 2 are no
         *  problem because of the 2nd lookahead symbol.  Alts 3 and 4 are
         *  identical and will therefore reach the rule end NFA state but
         *  predicting 2 different alts (no amount of future lookahead
         *  will render them deterministic/separable):
         *
         *  a : A B
         *    | A C
         *    | A
         *    | A
         *    ;
         *
         *  Here is a (slightly reduced) NFA of this grammar:
         *
         *  (1)-A->(2)-B->(end)-EOF->(8)
         *   |              ^
         *  (2)-A->(3)-C----|
         *   |              ^
         *  (4)-A->(5)------|
         *   |              ^
         *  (6)-A->(7)------|
         *
         *  where (n) is NFA state n.  To begin DFA conversion, the start
         *  state is created:
         *
         *  {(1|1),(2|2),(4|3),(6|4)}
         *
         *  Upon A, all NFA configurations lead to new NFA states yielding
         *  new DFA state:
         *
         *  {(2|1),(3|2),(5|3),(7|4),(end|3),(end|4)}
         *
         *  where the configurations with state end in them are added
         *  during the epsilon closure operation.  State end predicts both
         *  alts 3 and 4.  An error is reported, the latter configuration is
         *  flagged as resolved leaving the DFA state as:
         *
         *  {(2|1),(3|2),(5|3),(7|4|resolved),(end|3),(end|4|resolved)}
         *
         *  As NFA configurations are added to a DFA state during its
         *  construction, the reachable set of labels is computed.  Here
         *  reachable is {B,C,EOF} because there is at least one NFA state
         *  in the DFA state that can transition upon those symbols.
         *
         *  The final DFA looks like:
         *
         *  {(1|1),(2|2),(4|3),(6|4)}
         *              |
         *              v
         *  {(2|1),(3|2),(5|3),(7|4),(end|3),(end|4)} -B-> (end|1)
         *              |                        |
         *              C                        ----EOF-> (8,3)
         *              |
         *              v
         *           (end|2)
         *
         *  Upon AB, alt 1 is predicted.  Upon AC, alt 2 is predicted.
         *  Upon A EOF, alt 3 is predicted.  Alt 4 is not a viable
         *  alternative.
         *
         *  The algorithm is essentially to walk all the configurations
         *  looking for a conflict of the form (s|i) and (s|j) for i!=j.
         *  Use a hash table to track state+context pairs for collisions
         *  so that we have O(n) to walk the n configurations looking for
         *  a conflict.  Upon every conflict, track the alt number so
         *  we have a list of all nondeterministically predicted alts. Also
         *  track the minimum alt.  Next go back over the configurations, setting
         *  the "resolved" bit for any that have an alt that is a member of
         *  the nondeterministic set.  This will effectively remove any alts
         *  but the one we want from future consideration.
         *
         *  See resolveWithSemanticPredicates()
         *
         *  AMBIGUOUS TOKENS
         *
         *  With keywords and ID tokens, there is an inherit ambiguity in that
         *  "int" can be matched by ID also.  Each lexer rule has an EOT
         *  transition emanating from it which is used whenever the end of
         *  a rule is reached and another token rule did not invoke it.  EOT
         *  is the only thing that can be seen next.  If two rules are identical
         *  like "int" and "int" then the 2nd def is unreachable and you'll get
         *  a warning.  We prevent a warning though for the keyword/ID issue as
         *  ID is still reachable.  This can be a bit weird.  '+' rule then a
         *  '+'|'+=' rule will fail to match '+' for the 2nd rule.
         *
         *  If all NFA states in this DFA state are targets of EOT transitions,
         *  (and there is more than one state plus no unique alt is predicted)
         *  then DFA conversion will leave this state as a dead state as nothing
         *  can be reached from this state.  To resolve the ambiguity, just do
         *  what flex and friends do: pick the first rule (alt in this case) to
         *  win.  This means you should put keywords before the ID rule.
         *  If the DFA state has only one NFA state then there is no issue:
         *  it uniquely predicts one alt. :)  Problem
         *  states will look like this during conversion:
         *
         *  DFA 1:{9|1, 19|2, 14|3, 20|2, 23|2, 24|2, ...}-<EOT>->5:{41|3, 42|2}
         *
         *  Worse, when you have two identical literal rules, you will see 3 alts
         *  in the EOT state (one for ID and one each for the identical rules).

Setlist Manager Help

Setlist Manager Safety Rules
----------------------------
- only one copy of a song may exist and it can be enabled or disabled
- a song can only be loaded into the game one time because if
  multiple versions of the same song are loaded it will hang the game
- when a DLC song is added to any setlist the background changes to yellow
  and it is added to the corresponding SetlistSongs

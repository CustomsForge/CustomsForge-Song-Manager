Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast
=================================

<b>This script allows you to export layers in your Photoshop document as individual files</b> at a speed much faster than the built-in script from Adobe. So far it does not feature all the formats that the built-in version does, but more can be added easily upon request. Feel free to contribute to it and make it even more powerful!

Please, consider donating a modest sum if you enjoy using our script regularly and would like to see more features implemented sooner.

This script was originally built as a response to a [question](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/1961/export-photoshop-layers-to-individual-png-files-batch-process) on [graphicdesign.stackexchange.com](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/).

Features:
-------------------------------
* Supported export formats:
  * PNG (8 and 24 bit)
  * JPEG
  * Targa
  * BMP
* Handles nesting in grouped layers.
* Export either all layers or visible only.
* Shows current progress and allows to cancel any time.
* Shows proper layer count in advance.
* Files are named either using layer names or automatic layer indices.
* Lowest layer can be treated as common background.
* Exported images can have layer size or canvas size (trimming option).
* Last used dialog settings are remembered.
* A selected group can be exported as usual (layer by layer) while everything else is left in tact. (This way variable content can be exported for complex fixed background and foreground.)
* Can export groups as folder hierarchy. Conflicting folders are renamed.

Version History:

<b>17 Sept 2018</b> by [willena](https://github.com/Willena), [finscn](https://github.com/finscn), [jgod](https://github.com/jgod)

* Ability to ignore layer starting with an "exclude string" (implemented by @jgod, improved by me; Related subbranch : https://github.com/Willena/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/tree/jgod-ignore-layers-starting-with-bang)
* Similar to the background feature, it is now possible to keep the highest layer on top of all other layer when exporting. (Related issues : #108, #96, #42; Related subbranch : https://github.com/Willena/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/tree/first-layer-as-foreground)
* Groups can now be exported as a single image/layer. (implemented by @finscn, updated to be mergeable by me) ( related issues : #79 #70 #69 #21 #108 ; Related subbranch : https://github.com/Willena/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/tree/finscn-groups-to-layers)
* Add Transparent padding pixels before export (Related issue : #64 ; Related subbranch : https://github.com/Willena/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/tree/transparent-padding-pixels)
* Scale image before export (Related subbranch : https://github.com/Willena/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast/tree/scale-before-export)


<b>29 April 2016</b> by [Skjorn](https://github.com/skjorn)

* The option "Groups as folders" exports layers in a folder tree (same as groups) instead of a flat list.

<b>05 May 2015</b> by [Skjorn](https://github.com/skjorn)

* A selected group can be exported as usual (layer by layer) while everything else is left in tact. (This way variable content can be exported for complex fixed background and foreground.) _Works only for the first selected group!_ If no layer/group is selected, the topmost one is assumed by Photoshop. All parent groups of the selection are made visible. Visibility of exported layers is not taken into account; all are exported.

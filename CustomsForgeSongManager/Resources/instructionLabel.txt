Type the property key surrounded by &lt; and &gt;.  

Example - Using "Space Time" by Gojira.

&lt;title&gt;_&lt;artist&gt; = "dlc/Space Time_Gojira.psarc"
\\&lt;artist&gt;\\&lt;title&gt;_&lt;artist&gt; = "dlc/Gojira/Space Time_Gojira.psarc"

You can add directories as seen above, using "\\".

The "dd" property generates "_dd" if the song has Dynamic Difficulty.
It generates nothing if the song does not.

Ex. &lt;title&gt;_&lt;dd&gt; and Dynamic Difficulty exists:

Space Time_dd.psarc

If Dynamic Difficulty does not exist:

Space Time.psarc

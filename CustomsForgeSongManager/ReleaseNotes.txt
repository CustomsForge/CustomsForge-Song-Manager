DEVELOPER NOTE TO USERS:  THIS RELEASE CONTAINS NO VIRUSES OR TROJANS
Any such report from your AV is a false positive and is due to how
the installer and application updater works.  You must manually add 
CFSMSetup.exe and CustomsForgeSongManager.exe to you AV's whitelist
of approved/excluded applications.

IT IS A WASTE OF BOTH YOUR TIME, AND THE CF ADMINS AND DEVELOPERS TIME
for you to post on CF that this application contains viruses or trojans.  

If you don't believe this then simply don't install the CFSM application
until you can confirm it is safe directly through your AV provider.
